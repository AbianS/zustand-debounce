Welcome to **Zustand Debounce**, an extension for [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) that enhances state persistence by adding advanced features like _debounce_, _throttle_, _TTL_, and more.

<Callout type="info">
  **Why use `zustand-debounce`?** It helps optimize persistent write operations, reducing the number of times the state is saved to storage.
</Callout>

## Installation

Install the library using your favorite package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install zustand-debounce

# Using yarn
yarn add zustand-debounce

# Using pnpm
pnpm add zustand-debounce
```

## Basic Setup

Once the library is installed, you can create a store using `zustand` and add persistence with debounce options:

```tsx
import { create } from "zustand"
import { persist } from "zustand/middleware"
import { createDebouncedJSONStorage } from "zustand-debounce"

interface CounterState {
  count: number
  increment: () => void
}

export const useCounterStore = create<CounterState>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      count: 0,
      increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
    }),
    {
      name: "counter-storage",
      storage: createDebouncedJSONStorage(localStorage, {
        debounceTime: 2000, // Delay of 2000ms before saving
      }),
    },
  ),
)
```

This example creates a simple counter store, persisting its state in `localStorage` with a 2000ms debounce. This means the state will only be saved after the user stops interacting for that duration.

## Usage in a Component

Once the store is set up, you can use it inside a React component like this:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useCounterStore } from "./stores/counterStore"

function Counter() {
  const { count, increment } = useCounterStore()

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Counter
```

In this component, the counter value is displayed and can be incremented using the button. Each change in state will be persisted in storage after applying the debounce.

<Callout type="info">
  In this example, the state is saved to `localStorage` after 2000ms of user inactivity. This prevents saving the state too frequently.
</Callout>

So far, we've covered the basics of zustand-debounce. In the following sections, we'll explore more advanced features such as `throttle`, `onSave`, `onWrite`, and additional customizable settings.
