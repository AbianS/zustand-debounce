# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Answers to the most common questions about **Zustand Debounce**.

## ‚ùì General Questions

### What is Zustand Debounce?

Zustand Debounce is an extension for Zustand that optimizes storage write operations through intelligent debouncing. Instead of saving each change immediately, it groups multiple changes and saves them once after a period of inactivity.

### Why do I need debounce in my storage?

**Without debounce**: If a user makes 10 quick changes, 10 write operations are performed to localStorage/sessionStorage.

**With debounce**: The same 10 changes are grouped into 1 single write operation.

This results in:
- üöÄ Better performance
- üîã Less CPU usage
- üíæ Fewer I/O operations
- ‚ö° Smoother application

### Is it compatible with my current project?

Zustand Debounce is a **drop-in replacement** for `createJSONStorage`. You only need:

```typescript
// Before
storage: createJSONStorage(() => localStorage)

// After  
storage: createDebouncedJSONStorage('localStorage', { debounceTime: 1000 })
```

## üîß Configuration

### What `debounceTime` value should I use?

It depends on your use case:

- **100-500ms**: Infrequent changes (settings)
- **500-1000ms**: Forms and user inputs
- **1000-3000ms**: Text editors
- **3000ms+**: Data that changes very frequently (games, animations)

### When to use `throttleTime` vs `debounceTime`?

- **`debounceTime`**: Waits until there are no more changes
- **`throttleTime`**: Guarantees a maximum of writes per time

```typescript
// Only debounce: Wait 1 second after the last change
debounceTime: 1000

// Only throttle: Maximum one write every 5 seconds
throttleTime: 5000

// Both: Wait 1 second, but never more than 5 seconds
debounceTime: 1000,
throttleTime: 5000
```

### When to use `immediately: true`?

When you need certain changes to be saved instantly without delay:

```typescript
// For critical data like authentication
const authStorage = createDebouncedJSONStorage('localStorage', {
  immediately: true // Save tokens immediately
});
```

## üîÑ Retries

### When to enable retries?

Enable retries for important data that cannot be lost:

- ‚úÖ Game progress
- ‚úÖ Shopping carts
- ‚úÖ Important forms
- ‚ùå Visual preferences (theme, language)
- ‚ùå Temporary states

### What values to use for retries?

```typescript
// Conservative configuration
maxRetries: 3,
retryDelay: 1000

// Aggressive configuration for critical data
maxRetries: 5,
retryDelay: 2000
```

## üöÄ Performance

### Does it affect my application's performance?

Quite the opposite! Zustand Debounce **improves** performance:

- ‚úÖ Reduces I/O operations to storage
- ‚úÖ Prevents main thread blocking
- ‚úÖ Only 1.74 kB overhead
- ‚úÖ Zero external dependencies

### Does it work with React DevTools?

Yes, fully compatible. Zustand Debounce doesn't interfere with:
- React DevTools
- Zustand DevTools
- Time-travel debugging
- Hot reloading

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Changes are not being saved

**Possible causes:**

1. **`debounceTime` too high**: Changes are still being "debounced"
2. **Storage error**: Check console for errors
3. **Storage full**: localStorage has space limits

**Solutions:**

```typescript
// Add logging for debug
const storage = createDebouncedJSONStorage('localStorage', {
  debounceTime: 1000,
  onWrite: (key) => console.log('üìù Writing:', key),
  onSave: (key) => console.log('üíæ Saved:', key),
  onError: (key, error) => console.error('‚ùå Error:', key, error),
});
```

### Error: "localStorage is not available"

This occurs in non-browser environments (SSR, Node.js):

```typescript
// Solution: Detect environment
const storage = createDebouncedJSONStorage(
  typeof window !== 'undefined' ? 'localStorage' : 'memoryStorage',
  { debounceTime: 1000 }
);
```

### Retries are not working

Verify that you have the correct parameters:

```typescript
const storage = createDebouncedJSONStorage('localStorage', {
  maxRetries: 3,     // ‚úÖ Required
  retryDelay: 1000,  // ‚úÖ Required
  onRetry: (key, attempt, error, delay) => {
    console.log(`Retry ${attempt}: ${error.message}`);
  }
});
```

## üì± Compatibility

### Does it work with React Native?

Yes, but you need a custom adapter:

```typescript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const reactNativeAdapter = {
  getItem: async (key: string) => {
    return await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);
  },
  setItem: async (key: string, value: string) => {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, value);
  },
  removeItem: async (key: string) => {
    await AsyncStorage.removeItem(key);
  },
};

const storage = createDebouncedJSONStorage(reactNativeAdapter, {
  debounceTime: 1000
});
```

### Does it work with Next.js?

Perfectly compatible. For SSR:

```typescript
const storage = createDebouncedJSONStorage(
  typeof window !== 'undefined' ? 'localStorage' : 'memoryStorage',
  { debounceTime: 1000 }
);
```

### Does it work with other frameworks?

Yes, Zustand Debounce is framework-agnostic. It works with:
- ‚úÖ React
- ‚úÖ Vue (with pinia-zustand-adapter)
- ‚úÖ Angular
- ‚úÖ Svelte
- ‚úÖ Vanilla JavaScript

## üìù Best Practices

### How to structure multiple stores?

```typescript
// Separate by domain
const useUserStore = create(persist(..., {
  name: 'user-data',
  storage: createDebouncedJSONStorage('localStorage', {
    debounceTime: 1000,
    maxRetries: 3 // Important data
  })
}));

const useUIStore = create(persist(..., {
  name: 'ui-preferences', 
  storage: createDebouncedJSONStorage('localStorage', {
    debounceTime: 500 // Fast response for UX
  })
}));
```

### How to handle sensitive data?

```typescript
const sensitiveStorage = createDebouncedJSONStorage('sessionStorage', {
  debounceTime: 0, // No delay for sensitive data
  ttl: 30 * 60 * 1000, // Expires in 30 minutes
  serialize: (data) => {
    // Encrypt before saving
    return encrypt(JSON.stringify(data));
  },
  deserialize: (str) => {
    // Decrypt when reading
    return JSON.parse(decrypt(str));
  }
});
```
