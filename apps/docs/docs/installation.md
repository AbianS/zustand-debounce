# Installation

Learn how to install and configure **Zustand Debounce** in your project.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Zustand Debounce, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** version 16.0 or higher
- **Zustand** version 4.0.0 or higher installed in your project

:::info Note about Zustand
Zustand Debounce is an extension for Zustand, so you need to have Zustand installed as a dependency in your project.
:::

## Installation with NPM

```bash
npm install zustand-debounce
```

## Installation with Yarn

```bash
yarn add zustand-debounce
```

## Installation with PNPM

```bash
pnpm add zustand-debounce
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify that everything works correctly by creating a small example:

```typescript
import { createDebouncedJSONStorage } from 'zustand-debounce';

// If there are no errors, the installation was successful
const storage = createDebouncedJSONStorage('localStorage', {
  debounceTime: 1000
});

console.log('âœ… Zustand Debounce installed correctly!');
```

## Installing Zustand (If you don't have it yet)

If you don't have Zustand installed in your project yet:

```bash
# With npm
npm install zustand

# With yarn
yarn add zustand

# With pnpm
pnpm add zustand
```
