# Installation

Learn how to install and configure **Zustand Debounce** in your project.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Zustand Debounce, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** version 16.0 or higher
- **Zustand** version 4.5 or higher installed in your project (tested with 4.5 and 5.x)

:::info Note about Zustand
Zustand Debounce is an extension for Zustand, so you need to have Zustand installed as a dependency in your project.
:::

## Installation with NPM

```bash
npm install zustand-debounce
```

## Installation with Yarn

```bash
yarn add zustand-debounce
```

## Installation with PNPM

```bash
pnpm add zustand-debounce
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify that everything works correctly by creating a small example:

```typescript
import { createDebouncedJSONStorage } from 'zustand-debounce';

// If there are no errors, the installation was successful
const storage = createDebouncedJSONStorage('localStorage', {
  debounceTime: 1000
});

console.log('✅ Zustand Debounce installed correctly!');
```

## Installing Zustand (If you don't have it yet)

If you don't have Zustand installed in your project yet:

```bash
# With npm
npm install zustand

# With yarn
yarn add zustand

# With pnpm
pnpm add zustand
```

## TypeScript Configuration

If you're using TypeScript, you don't need to install additional types since **Zustand Debounce includes its own TypeScript types**.

### Recommended `tsconfig.json` Configuration

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2018",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]
  }
}
```

## Bundle Size

Zustand Debounce is built to be extremely light:

- **📦 Bundle size**: 1.4 kB (minified + brotli)
- **🚀 Zero dependencies**: No additional external dependencies
- **⚡ No runtime import of zustand**: only its types are used

## Compatibility
